# Options Pricing with Neural Networks and Gradient Boosters
The XGBoost algorithm has been regarded as the gold standard for machine learning since its inception in 2014. Neural Networks have also showcased incredible abilities in learning extremely complicated patterns in data with large numbers of input variables. Most recently, however, machine learning practitioners have praised Google Cloud’s AutoML models for their ease of use and incredible accuracy. This study hopes to discover if TensorFlow deep learning models, XGBoost gradient boosted decision trees, and Google Cloud’s AutoML Regressor can outperform the Black Scholes model.
